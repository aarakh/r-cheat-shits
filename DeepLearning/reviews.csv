We ordered alfredo pasta, jain margarita pizza & fried wonton. Pasta & wonton were good but pizza was way to sweet. Upon confronting the staff their response was slow & made faces. They responded that we use ready-made sauces so it would taste sweet only in a rude way & didn't mention it at the time of placing the order.

100,Veronica's,3.2,Cafe,"1,500",mumbai,"I feel this place is overhyped because of Instagram. There is nothing special or different about this place. It’s just like many other cafés/restaurants. The menu is very similar to many other places. the food choice is EXTREMELY POOR. THE BEVERAGE MENU HAS MORE OPTIONS THAN THE FOOD MENU.  THE PLACE IS really small and the seating system is really bad too, they made us sit on a two person table when we were 3 of us and refused to give us a 4 person table and we sat pretty uncomfortably.

The coffee was good , dont remember the name of the brew. The berry frappe was worth 350 rs. And consisted of churned milk with vanilla ice cream and strawberry syrup with whipped cream on the top. I think regular shakes available in local joints tastes better than this. It was uber sweet and had no 'berry' whatsoever. Poor attempt at such a renowned hotel! The danish pastry was another disappointment. Topped with what seemed like stale mango shrikhand and cubes of stale mango, it was another bad outcome.

105,Pune Baking Company - JW Marriott Pune,4.5,"Cafe, Sandwich, Desserts","1,300",pune,This place was one of our favourite once upon a time… but now it’s become beyond pathetic. The Blt sandwich had one piece of bacon and one piece of mini tomato and that’s it just bread…last time we also faced the same issue with the quality inspite of complaining they haven’t taken any action and argue with us that everything is right. We have been regular here for almost 12 years so it’s really dreadful experience…we will now discontinue going to this place and pass on this to our family friends as well. Guys really sad to see this

The gnocchi pesto pasta was disappointing, with the gnocchi resembling mush and lacking any texture. Our order of ratatouille was more akin to mixed vegetables, rather than the traditional dish. Thankfully, the drinks were nice, providing a solitary redeeming factor. A mix-up occurred where our gnocchi pasta was initially delivered to the wrong table, then subsequently brought to us. This was an unacceptable mistake. Overall, Farmhouse used to be a quality restaurant, but its standards have evidently declined. Sadly, I don't see it making a comeback. It's done."

322,Clean Slate Cafe,4.1,"Cafe, Continental, Italian, Beverages, Desserts",850,bangalore,Worst place ever. We ordered cheesy fries and mixed sauce pasta. They probably used the ready pasta sauce you get in grocery stores because it tasted that artificial. Cheesy fries basically has Maida cooked in water as “cheese sauce”. I don’t understand why this place has 4+ rating on zomato. Please save your bucks from this place 
323,Clean Slate Cafe,4.1,"Cafe, Continental, Italian, Beverages, Desserts",850,bangalore,mojito was like medicine.. Sweet plus bitterness plus no mint.. I think they used some stored syrup that was expired. Then we ordered honey chilli baby corn which that so much carrot and very little baby corn. The starter was just okay. Very pricey this place is. 
324,Clean Slate Cafe,4.1,"Cafe, Continental, Italian, Beverages, Desserts",850,bangalore,Quantity was so less that I finished having the salad in less than 2 minutes. Not worth the money at all.  Even the taste wasn’t great.
325,The Grey House Cafe,4,"Cafe, Desserts, Fast Food, Italian, Beverages",450,bangalore,Good food at an affordable price. We ordered almond soup.

Variety of food and drink options are available on the menu. Taste-wise, seasoning was a hit and miss in the dishes. We ordered the spinach soup (florantine) and Al Fredo pasta with mushrooms. The soup was not as hot as expected, with a slightly skewed proportion of salt-pepper. Basically, namak was not swad anusar. The pasta on the other hand was much better, the saving grace being the mushrooms which we added to the Al fredo. I’m not sure how it would have tasted without the well-seasoned mushrooms. We also ordered coffee which almost get like a dessert so that might be a tad disappointing for hard core coffee lovers....read more"

668,Chamiers Cafe,4,"Cafe, Fast Food, Continental, Italian, Beverages","1,200",chennai,Extremely horrible service. The waiter was so rude that he actually snatched the plate away from our table. A total disappointment.
669,Chamiers Cafe,4,"Cafe, Fast Food, Continental, Italian, Beverages","1,200",chennai,"It’s so sad to see that Chamiers Cafe, once a cozy place for great food and ambience has lost all of its charm in the recent years. While the food is ridiculously overpriced for its underwhelming food, perhaps the biggest problem they must overcome is their pathetic service. The staff are not only slow, but also disrespectful and rude, so much that it may feel like you’re eating there for free. If you’re lucky, you may receive service from one of the friendly staff which are very less in number, of course.

Everything you touch will show a big red flag, from a menu card to the look of the dish leave alone taste. Cafe that doesn't have coffee, Italian cafe that has no clue how a pasta looks or tastes.
